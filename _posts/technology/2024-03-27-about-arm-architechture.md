# What is ARM architecture
The ARM architecture, developed by Advanced RISC Machines (ARM), is a Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) processor widely used in embedded devices. It was initiated in 1983 by computer scientists Sophie Wilson and Steve Furber. ARM CPUs are designed for low power consumption, making them dominant in the mobile market and personal computers like single-board computers.
ARM architecture specifies rules governing hardware operations when executing instructions, forming a contract between hardware and software. This architecture is fundamental to the world's largest compute ecosystem, enabling partners to efficiently, affordably, and securely build products. ARM's architecture designs have been successful across various markets, with over 280 billion devices containing ARM-based chips. The architecture supports innovation in mobile devices, IoT devices, and machine learning applications.


## Advantages of ARM architecture over other architectures
The advantages of ARM architecture over other architectures include its focus on low-power and high-performance applications, making it ideal for mobile devices, embedded systems, and IoT devices. ARM processors offer a balance between performance and power consumption, providing a good compromise between speed and energy efficiency, which is suitable for a wide range of applications. 
Additionally, ARM architecture benefits from a wide range of software support, with operating systems like Linux, Android, iOS, and Windows offering ARM compatibility, providing users access to various software applications and a familiar environment. ARM processors are known for their scalability, diverse market adoption, and community support, making them widely used in smartphones, tablets, laptops, servers, routers, cameras, consoles, and many other devices. 
Furthermore, ARM processors are cost-effective to create and implement in devices like mobile phones due to their simple design and low power requirements, offering better battery life and heat dissipation compared to other architectures. 
Overall, the advantages of ARM architecture lie in its efficiency in power consumption, performance per watt ratio, energy efficiency leading to better heat dissipation, scalability across different devices, and cost-effectiveness in various applications.


## Disadvantages of ARM architecture compared to other architectures
The disadvantages of ARM architecture compared to other architectures include its lack of compatibility and interoperability with systems and applications designed for x86, which is the dominant architecture for desktop and laptop computers. This incompatibility can limit the wider adoption of ARM in the computer market, as some software and hardware developed for x86 may not run well on ARM devices without emulation or translation, affecting performance and functionality. 
Additionally, ARM architecture is not as standardized and consistent as other architectures, leading to variations between different ARM processors and devices, impacting software and hardware portability and compatibility. The complexity of developing programs for RISC-based architectures like ARM requires more effort from skilled programmers due to the need for sophisticated compilers and optimizers, making it less straightforward compared to CISC-based architectures like x86. 
Furthermore, ARM processors may have limitations in terms of raw computing power, which can make them less suitable for resource-intensive tasks compared to other architectures like x86. Overall, the main disadvantages of ARM architecture lie in its compatibility challenges with x86 systems, lack of standardization leading to variations between devices, complexity in programming, and potential limitations in computing power for certain applications.


## Devices that use ARM architecture
Some popular devices that use ARM architecture include smartphones like Apple's iPhones and Samsung's Galaxy series, tablets such as Apple's iPads, and various other consumer electronics like digital cameras, portable media players, and gaming consoles like the Nintendo Switch. Additionally, ARM-based processors are found in devices like Microsoft's Surface tablets, Asus's Eee Pad Transformer tablet computers, and several Chromebook laptops. The Raspberry Pi Foundation designed its own chips based on ARM architecture for their Raspberry Pi boards, with the Cortex-M-based RP2040 being the first custom chip created by the foundation. ARM architecture is also prevalent in automotive systems for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), healthcare equipment like imaging devices and prosthetics, as well as in aerospace applications and IoT devices due to its power efficiency and versatility. 
Overall, ARM architecture is widely used across a diverse range of products, showcasing its adaptability and relevance in modern computing ecosystems. 


### Market share of ARM architecture in premium smartphone
The current market share of ARM architecture in the premium smartphone is estimated to exceed 99%, as reported in recent sources. ARM Holdings, the company behind ARM architecture, has maintained this dominant position in the smartphone sector for many years, with its chips widely used in nearly every smartphone and a significant portion of consumer electronics. This high market share reflects the widespread adoption and integration of ARM-based processors in mobile devices, showcasing the architecture's strong presence and influence in the mobile computing industry.
