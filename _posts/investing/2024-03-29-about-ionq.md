### Disadvantage of using trapped ions
 Trapped ions offer advantages such as long coherence times and high fidelity operations, but they also present challenges. One key limitation is the need for an ultrahigh-vacuum environment and the technological complexity associated with building scalable quantum processing nodes. This requirement for a controlled environment and intricate control systems can be a drawback when compared to some other qubit modalities that may not have the same level of environmental sensitivity or complexity in their setup.
